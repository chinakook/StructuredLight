# CameraCalibration

This pure-java application can compute the intrinsic camera matrix, extrinsic camera matrix, and the radial distortion coefficients given a directory full of images of a calibration target and a configuration file. 

A pure-java application for structured light. Easily compute projection matrices and radial distortions for cameras and projectors. Compute and match phase to find corresponding points. Compute a 3D point cloud by triangulation. The goal is to make highly accurate calibration and 3D surface scanning an easy task.
