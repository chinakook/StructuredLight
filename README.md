# StructuredLight

A pure-java application for structured light. The goal is to make highly accurate calibration and 3D surface scanning an easy task.

- Easily compute projection matrices and radial distortions for cameras and projectors. 

- Compute and match phase to find corresponding points. 

- Compute a 3D point cloud by triangulation.
